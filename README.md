# CSE414Final_Project

I created an application that ran on the command line terminal, and connected to a database server on Microsoft Azure. I programed part of an appointment scheduler for vaccinations, where the users are patients and caregivers keeping track of vaccine stock and appointments. 

The code that I implemented can be found in: 

1) Create Table Statements: vaccine-scheduler-java-main --> src/main --> scheduler --> model 
2) Java Implementation: vaccine-scheduler-java-main --> src/main --> scheduler --> Scheduler.java
